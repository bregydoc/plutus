# Plutus

Plutus is a modern tool to manage your payments, charges and invoices of your products. This tool is payment gateway agnostic and works like a new layer on your traditional payment stack.

## Important

Currently, plutus only works with Culqi bridge, culqi is a peruvian payment gateway. My focus is implement a Strip bridge and with this continue work on the dashboard client of plutus (see [client dir](https://github.com/bregydoc/plutus/tree/master/client)).
